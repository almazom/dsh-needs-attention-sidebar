/* The data route must stay inside the panel's mount prefix.

 * 2026-10-31 operator report: the page at https://dsh.example.com/stable/duty kept the
 * block hidden and the console said
 *   [needs-attention] refresh failing: … Unexpected end of JSON input
 * because the client fetched a hardcoded "/api/dsh-needs-attention/sessions",
 * which leaves the /stable mount, lands on the edge root and answers an empty
 * body. The boot HTML writes plugin URLs RELATIVE ("plugins/??…") for exactly
 * this reason. The anchor fix was fine; this was the real blocker on his screen.
